# TORCS AI Racing Controller

## üìã Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent racing controller for The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS) as part of an AI course assignment. The goal is to design a controller that can effectively race against other cars on different tracks while maintaining optimal performance metrics.

### Project Objectives
- Design a controller that can compete and win races against other cars
- Implement effective telemetry data processing
- Maintain optimal performance metrics:
  - Speed optimization
  - Obstacle avoidance
  - Track following
  - Gear management
- Develop a non-rule-based solution using machine learning

## üéØ Our Solution

We implemented a hybrid approach combining manual control capabilities with machine learning-based autonomous driving:

### 1. Manual Control Mode
- Real-time keyboard-based control interface for data collection
- Intelligent gear management with automatic shifting
- Telemetry data collection for training
- Safety features and collision detection

### 2. Learning-Based Autonomous Mode
- Machine learning model trained on manual driving data
- Feature engineering pipeline for optimal performance
- Real-time action prediction based on car state
- Safety checks and gear management
